JSON Web Tokens C++ lib
#######################

This lib exposes a simple class to work with signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
It had been developped by Mozilla while making a C++ implementation of
BrowserID.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are described `in this document
<http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-jones-json-web-token.html>`_

Installation
============

Running `make` and `make install` should do the trick.

Dependencies
============

You need to have the following library installed on your system:

* Cryptopp for the cryptographic functions.
* Nhlohmann's brilliant [json][json_link] library for parsing decoded jwts.
